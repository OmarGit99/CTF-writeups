# Zoooom

In this one we got an image(JPEG), hekkerman, which when analyzed using xxd or any hexeditor(I used binwalk)

Remember we do this to find any other filetype-headers that can be detected... we can do this simply with binwalk or manually go through the hex dump using a hexeditor

We find a couple of headers.. All TIFF/JPEG/PNG types.
So in order to extract them all we have to do is edit the scalpel.conf file to the specific file extensions

Andd then use the tool to extract the files

We will get a couple of unusable files but the flag would be within an openable jpg

DONE!
