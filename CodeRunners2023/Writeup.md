I have quite a deal of CTF (Capture the Flag) experience. When I saw the images, my first thought was that it must be Steganography.
There happen to be a variety of Steganography techniques and online tools for detecting hidden messages in text.
I attempted a number of common methods, including LSB, RGB Inverse, LSB half, and Changing Bit Planes Red-Blue-Green.
Using LSB half and Changing Bit-Planes, a solution was eventually found.
