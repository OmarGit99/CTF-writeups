# Authentication bypass via OAuth implicit flow

In this lab we have to exploit the OAuth authenticate token to allow us to validate as another user

We need the Burp suite tool to track the HTTP requests to see the entire process

Go to the dummy website provided in the lab using the Burp Suite Proxy and sign in using your login and password given.


Now go back and check the HTTP history

The POST request with the /authenticate is the URL you need.. so just plug in to the repeater and use the victim's email address. Now all you need to send the request and copy the URL as original session then open it in chromium.

The lab is now solved!
